### ShowFitFile

This plugin allows you to add a map and summary exercise data from a .fit (Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer) file. The maps are generated using leafletJS with the map tiles provided by OpenStreetMap.

## Usage

Upload the .fit file to your Media Library, then simply create a map from the file by adding the following ShortCode to your post:

![Sample](/images/SuieMap.png)

[showfitfile file="2019-06-16-10-48-12.fit"]

To change the units to Imperial (default is metric):

[showfitfile file="2019-06-16-10-48-12.fit" units = "imperial"]

To change the route colour (default is 'Red'):

[showfitfile file="2019-06-16-10-48-12.fit" colour = "blue"]

To allow scrolling and zooming of the map (default is 'no')

[showfitfile file="2019-06-16-10-48-12.fit" interactive = "yes"]
